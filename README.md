# AOA_Display_EFIS

The Angle of Attach display unit complements the main EFIS Display unit and works as an I2C slave to the main Display.

The main reason for showing AoA information on a separate display is that I want the display to be high up on the instrument panel and to be very prominent and colour coded.
